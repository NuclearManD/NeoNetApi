# NeoNetApi
NeoNet API in Python, Java, and Arduino

NeoNet is a network protocol I use that is simple and reliable.  It can be built on any stream, so it makes there be no
difference between an Arduino's serial port and a TCP socket.

Later I will implement routing and connections that will allow large networks to exist over anything from LoRa to TCP - and
a mixture thereof.

Connections NeoNet should be able to be (easily) built upon:
 * TCP
 * Serial Ports
 * Bluetooth?
 * GPRS
 * More, I'm sure...
